# OVERCORE : Space Miner 

## Description

*OVERCORE : Space Miner* is an arcade space shooter I developed myself over the course of one month. The goal was to feature a small yet complete game on my personnal GitHub. Balancing between future-proof code architecture and non-overkill solutions, the programming behind *Overcore* is simple yet robust enough for future improvements. It was also a great opportunity to learn and use UIToolkit, Unity's latest solution to create UI in games.

## Code Walkthrough

If you're interested in reading and understanding the code's architecture and most important classes, feel free to clone the project and check-out its Wiki on GitHub.

Also, you can read about OVERCORE's main game design decisions on the Miro Whiteboard, link available down below. 

### **⚠ Important Note ⚠**

Because general application's logic and game's logic as been separated into two different scene (respectively Application.unity and Game.unity), we need to load 2 scenes at the same time in Editor. You can use `SceneSetupShortcut`'s MenuItem to load both scene faster in Editor

- In Unity, in the menu bar at the top, click on "Scene Setup Shortcuts"
- Click on either "Game" or "Titlecard". It loads the needed scenes automaticaly
- Click "Play" and try them in the Editor
